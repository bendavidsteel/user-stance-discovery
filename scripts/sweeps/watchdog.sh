# Kill sweep trials that exceed a wall-clock budget.
#
# Some configurations drive the SDE solver into batches that take minutes each,
# which stalls the agent indefinitely; killing the trial lets it move on.
#
# Trials already running when the watchdog starts are left alone: they predate
# the budget, and one of them may be a long run that is still making progress.
#
# The default sits above the sweep's own `timeout`, so this only ever fires on
# a trial that ignored SIGTERM -- otherwise it would be racing the budget and
# killing healthy trials.
